== Description ==

It is a useful plugin to display the metadata information and custom fields of posts and pages or custom post type. You can either display date, author, comments, views or sticky meta information and custom fields list or maybe if you like then you can display all of them.

### Features
You can list the following information:

* Published Date (The day when the post is published on the website)
* Author (The Person who created the post or page)
* Views (Number of people which have seen the post)
* Sticky (If the post is sticky or not)
* Comments (Number of comments on the post)
* Custom Fields (The default custom fields of posts and pages) for more details please consult [Custom Fields](https://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields) codex page.
